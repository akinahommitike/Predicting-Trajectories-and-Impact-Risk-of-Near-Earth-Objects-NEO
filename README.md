# Predicting-Trajectories-and-Impact-Risk-of-Near-Earth-Objects-NEO
The goal of this project is to predict the occurrence of solar flares using various linear models and discriminant analysis techniques. Solar flares can significantly impact satellite communications and power grids, making their prediction critical for mitigating potential disruptions.
**Steps Involved:**

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather data from NASA's Near-Earth Object Program or relevant databases.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for modeling (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering).
2.Model Development:

Implement LDA and GDA to classify and predict NEO trajectories based on various features such as size, speed, distance from Earth, and orbital characteristics.
Incorporate regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
3.Evaluation and Risk Assessment:

Evaluate the models' accuracy in predicting NEO trajectories and assess their impact risk probabilities.
Compare the effectiveness of LDA and GDA in handling the classification task and understanding NEO behavior.
4. Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualize predicted trajectories and impact probabilities to provide insights into potential NEO threats.
Interpret the results to suggest mitigation strategies or further research directions.
5.Documentation and Reporting:

Document the entire process, including data sources, methodology, and results.
Prepare a report or presentation summarizing findings, model performance, and implications for planetary defense and space exploration.

Benefits:

Planetary Defense: Enhance early warning systems and decision-making capabilities for potential NEO impacts.
Space Exploration: Improve understanding of NEO characteristics and their implications for future space missions.
This project not only leverages advanced statistical techniques like LDA and GDA but also addresses practical challenges in planetary defense and space exploration, making it both scientifically relevant and impactful.
