**Introduction**
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and natural language processing to predict the trajectories and potential impact risks of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The application provides an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions and analyses.

**Features**
Trajectory Prediction: Predict the trajectories of NEOs using machine learning models.
Impact Risk Assessment: Assess the potential impact risks of NEOs.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of uploaded text files.
Interactive Chat Interface: Use ChainLit to interact with the application via a chatbot interface.
OpenAI Integration: Leverage OpenAI's GPT-3 API for natural language processing and generation.
**Installation**
Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- OpenAI API key
**Steps**
1. Clone the repository:

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

3. Install the required packages:

4. Replace 'your_openai_api_key' in the app.py file with your actual OpenAI API key.

**Usage**
Run the ChainLit application:


Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

Interact with the chatbot:

Predict Trajectories and Impact Risk:
Enter your queries regarding NEO trajectories and impact risks.

Sentiment Analysis:
Ask for sentiment analysis and upload a text file when prompted.

**Technologies Used**
Python 3.10
ChainLit: For creating the interactive chatbot interface.
OpenAI GPT-3 API: For natural language processing and generation.
TextBlob: For sentiment analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
